## Overview

E-commerce landing page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

- Structure with HTML.
- Layout Design with CSS.
- Dynamic functions with JavavScript.
- Adding LightBox feature.
- Add colours to elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM Naming Convention
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Negative number as box shadow width can make the width of the box shadow smaller.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<p1>Clothes</p1>
```

```css
p:hover {
  box-shadow: 0px 57px 0px -8px orange;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

Changing colour of SVGs.
